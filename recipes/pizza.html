    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <h2>The base</h2>
    <p>We'll start with the base, the crispy crust that holds it all together. With the crust, you can go a few ways: You can make homemade pizza with store-bought dough; use pre-baked crusts (such as Boboli) or even English muffins and pita bread for personal pizzas; or make your own pizza dough. Here's how Chef John makes simple no-knead pizza dough. (He also makes a pretty mean Cauliflower Pizza Crust.) Watch the video to see exactly how the pizza dough should look before setting it aside to rise. You'll also see Chef John's patented "rotate, stretch, and tuck" move for forming the dough.</p>
    <h2>Pizza sauce tips</h2>
    <p>Now for the sauce. There are loads of delicious pre-made marinara sauces for pizza sauce. We have oodles of homemade pizza sauce recipes, too. Beyond red pizza sauces, don't forget pesto sauces, white sauces, or even a simple olive oil and garlic sauce. They will expand your pizza potential by almost infinite proportions. </p>
    <h2>Pizza topping</h2>
    <p>There's almost no limit to the toppings you can pile on a pizza. Tomato sauce and pepperoni you know. But apples and walnuts? For sure. Fresh figs and prosciutto? Of course! Sweet corn and peas? Well, in Europe and Japan, corn and peas are common pizza toppings. Bottom line, pizza is open to an infinite amount of creativity where toppings are concerned. </p>
